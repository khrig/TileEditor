# TileEditor
Tile editor for tile based games

* Works with sprite sheets and sprites sized 32x32.
* Sprite sheets needs to be divisable by 32.

# Todo:
1. ~~Compress maps~~
2. ~~Clear map/new map~~
3. ~~Multiple layers~~
4. ~~Menu (like a real menu at the top)~~
5. Layer types (which layer is collisions)
